# George-bailey-Christmas-simulator
Small python project I wrote to simulate George Bailey and his Christmas's outcomes using random functions

I wanted to experiment with random functions in python as I learn and I was watching "It's a wonderful life" on new years while writing this. The program uses random.choices and appends it to a file and counts it for the data. The program starts with asking the user how many Christmas's they want to simulate, then it runs a random function to pick wether or not Bailey picked to live or not exist and tells you what he picked most along with a count.
